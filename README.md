# Sample Project

This file contains a brief overview of the project.

This *Sample Project* sets up a structure that I intend to use for future projects. As a git repository, this is intended to be cloned and modified for new projects so that less time is spent setting up a project and more consistency is achieved across projects.

The structure is based on recommendations found in G. Wilson et al., "Good enough practices in scientific computing," *PLOS Computational Biology*, vol. 13, p. e1005510, June 2017. DOI: [10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510).
